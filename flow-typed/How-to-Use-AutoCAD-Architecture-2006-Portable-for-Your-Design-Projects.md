## How to Create and Edit Dynamic Blocks
 
Dynamic blocks are a feature of AutoCAD Architecture 2006 that allow you to create blocks that can be modified during insertion with new grips and action features. This reduces the need for having multiple blocks for different variations of the same object. For example, you can create a dynamic block for a door that can change its size, orientation, and swing direction.
 
To create a dynamic block, you need to use the Block Editor. You can access it by selecting a block and clicking on the Edit Block Definition button on the Block toolbar. In the Block Editor, you can add parameters and actions to define how the block can be changed. Parameters are properties that control the geometry of the block, such as length, angle, or visibility. Actions are operations that modify the block based on the parameters, such as stretch, rotate, or flip.
 
To edit a dynamic block, you need to use the Properties palette. You can access it by selecting a block and clicking on the Properties button on the Standard toolbar. In the Properties palette, you can change the values of the parameters and see how they affect the block. You can also use grips to manipulate the block visually.
 
## How to Annotate and Compose Drawings with Text and Tables
 
Annotating and composing drawings is an important part of documenting your design. AutoCAD Architecture 2006 provides tools for creating and editing text and table information in your drawings.
 
To create text, you need to use the Mtext command. You can access it by clicking on the Multiline Text button on the Draw toolbar. In the Mtext Editor, you can type your text and format it with options such as font, size, color, alignment, and bullet points. You can also insert fields that display dynamic data from your drawing, such as area or date.
 
To create tables, you need to use the Table command. You can access it by clicking on the Table button on the Draw toolbar. In the Table Creation dialog box, you can specify the number of rows and columns, the cell size, and the style of your table. You can also import data from external sources such as Excel or CSV files.
 
To edit text or tables, you need to use the Properties palette or double-click on them. You can change their properties such as position, rotation, scale, layer, or style. You can also edit their contents by adding or deleting rows or columns, merging or splitting cells, or applying formulas.
